# Reno-Calculator

### Description
This project addresses the common inefficiencies faced by clients and contractors during the process of searching for renovation projects. Our application integrates a powerful cost calculator and offers both clients and contractors a secure and dependable platform for seamless communication. 

Say goodbye to the hassles of renovation project management and hello to efficiency and transparency.

### Getting Started
Conforming to best practices, installing and running the backend system is done through a virtual environment. To get your own **virtual environment**, run this code in the terminal in your place of choice:

```
python -m venv {{NAME_OF_ENV}}
```

Then, activate your environment using this:

```
{{NAME_OF_ENV}}\Scripts\activate
```

Once done, you need to **install** the necessary packages/libraries used (they can be found in the requirements.txt file)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That should provide you with a good enough start! Good luck!
